    <hr/>
    <h4>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h4>
    <h5>Though people often use [[physical

        activity]] and exercise interchangeably, the terms have different definitions.
         “Physical activity” refers to any body movement that burns calories,<br> 
         whether it’s for work or play, daily chores, or the daily commute. 
         “Exercise,” a subcategory of physical activity, refers to -<br>planned, 
         structured, and repetitive- activitis aimed at improving physical fitness and health.[1]
          Exercise is a bodily activity that<br> enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health
           and wellness. Physical activity is number one most common health issue in the world.<br> Staying
            physically active can help prevent or delay certain diseases, including some cancers, heart
             disease and diabetes, and also relieve depression and improve mood.[2]

    <h3 id="brain" >brain activity</h3>
    <p style="color:gray;">The benefits of physical exercise, especially aerobic exercise, have positive
         effects on brain function
         on multiple fronts, ranging from the molecular to behavioral level.<br> According to a study done 
         by the
          Department of Exercise Science at the University of Georgia,
         even briefly exercising for 20 minutes facilitates information processing and memory functions.[4]<br>

        Exercise affects the brain on multiple fronts. It increases heart rate, which pumps
         more oxygen to the brain. It also aids the bodily release of a plethora of hormones,
          all of<br> which participate in aiding and providing a nourishing environment for the growth
           of brain cells.[5]<br>
        
        Exercise stimulates the brain plasticity by stimulating growth of new connections 
        between cells in a wide array of important cortical areas of the brain. Research from 
        UCLA<br> demonstrated that exercise increased growth factors in the brain—making it easier 
        for the brain to grow new neuronal connections.[6]</p>
        <h3 id="weight">Weight management</h3>
        <p style="color:gray;">Both diet and physical activity play a critical role in
             maintaining a healthy body weight, losing excess body weight, or maintaining 
             successful weight loss.[8]<br> Physical activity helps control weight by using excess
              calories that would otherwise be stored as fat. Most foods we eat contain calories, 
              and everything we do uses calories, including sleeping, breathing, and digesting food.<br>
               Balancing the calories we eat with the calories we use through
             physical activity will help us reach and maintain a healthy weight.[9]</p>

             <hr>
             <p style="color:gray;">The most common health risks include cardiovascular diseases, diabetes
                 type 2 and some cancers.[10]

                Obesity is a complex disease that affects whole body metabolism and is associated with an
                 increased 
                risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Physical exercise results in
                 numerous 
                health benefits and is an important tool to combat obesity and its co-morbidities,
                 including cardiovascular
                 disease. Exercise prevents both the onset and development of cardiovascular disease and is an
                  important
                  therapeutic tool to improve outcomes for patients with cardiovascular disease. Some benefits
                   of exercise
                   include enhanced mitochondrial function, restoration and improvement of vasculature, and
                    the release of
                    myokines from skeletal muscle that preserve or augment cardiovascular function. In this 
                    review we will
                     discuss the mechanisms through which exercise promotes cardiovascular health. Regular 
                     physical exercise
                      has several beneficial effects on overall health. While decreasing body mass and
                       adiposity are not the
                       primary outcomes of exercise, exercise can mediate several diseases that accompany
                        obesity including
                        T2D and CVD. Several recent studies have shown that sustained physical activity 
                        is associated with 
                        decreased markers of inflammation, improved metabolic health, decreased risk of 
                        heart failure, and 
                        improved overall survival.[11][12][13] There are several risk factors leading to
                         the development and
                         progression of CVD, but one of the most prominent is a sedentary lifestyle. 
                         A sedentary lifestyle
                          can be characterized by both obesity and consistently low levels of physical
                           activity. Thus,
                           lifestyle interventions that aim to increase physical activity 
                and decrease obesity are attractive therapeutic methods to combat most non-congenital types
                 of CVD.[14]</p>
             <h3 id="cardio" >Cardiovascular Risk Factors</h3>
             <p style="color:gray;">Regular physical exercise is associated with numerous health benefits to
                 reduce the progression and development of obesity, T2D, and CVD. Several randomized clinical
                  trials have demonstrated that lifestyle interventions including moderate exercise and a 
                  healthy diet improve cardiovascular health in at-risk populations. Individuals with 
                  metabolic syndrome who participated in a 4 month program of either a diet 
                  (caloric restriction) or exercise intervention had reduced adiposity, decreased systolic, 
                  diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure, and lower total and low-density lipoprotein 
                  (LDL) cholesterol lipid profiles compared to the control group. Both the diet and exercise 
                  intervention improve these cardiovascular outcomes to a similar extent.[15]

                Several previous studies have investigated the effects of diet and exercise, independently or
                 in combination, on metabolic and cardiovascular health and have determined that diet,
                  exercise, or a
                  combination of diet and exercise induces weight loss, decreases visceral adiposity,
                   lowers plasma
                   triglycerides, plasma glucose, HDL levels, and blood pressure, and improves VO2max.
                    Importantly, 
                   several of these beneficial effects of exercise are evident independent of weight loss.
                    Studies 
                   have shown that exercise can improve metabolic and cardiovascular health independent of 
                   changes
                    in body weight, including improved glucose homeostasis, endothelial function,
                     blood pressure, 
                    and HDL levels. These data indicate exercise, independent of changes in body mass,
                     results in 
                    significant improvements in cardiovascular and metabolic health. Although a detailed 
                    analysis 
                    of the vast impact of diet on cardiometabolic health is outside the scope of this review, the 
                    importance of diet and exercise in tandem should not be ignored, as many studies have 
                    shown that
                     cardiometabolic health is improved to a higher extent in response to a combined diet
                      and exercise 
                     programs compared to either intervention alone.</p>
                     <h3 id="cardiac" ">Cardiac rehabilitation</h3>
                     <p style="color:gray">Exercise is also an important therapeutic treatment for patients
                         who have cardiovascular diseases. A systematic review of 63 studies found that
                          exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation improved cardiovascular function. These
                           studies consisted of various forms of aerobic exercise at a range of intensities
                            (from 50 to 95% VO2), over a multitude of time periods (1–47 months). Overall,
                             exercise significantly reduced CVD-related mortality, decreased risk of MI,
                              and improved quality of life. Another study looked specifically in patients 
                              with atherosclerosis post-revascularization surgery. Patients who underwent 
                              60 min of exercise per day on a cycle ergometer for 4 weeks had an increase 
                              blood flow reserve (29%) and improved endothelium-dependent vasodilatation.
                               A recent study provided personalized aerobic exercise rehabilitation programs
                                for patients who had an acute myocardial infarction for 1 year after a 
                                coronary intervention surgery. The patients who underwent the exercise 
                                rehabilitation program had increased ejection fraction (60.81 vs. 53% 
                                control group), increased exercise tolerance, and reduced cardiovascular
                                 risk factors 6 months after starting the exercise rehabilitation program. 
                                 This improvement in cardiovascular health in patients with atherosclerosis
                                  or post-MI is likely the result of increased myocardial perfusion in 
                                  response to exercise, however more research is required to fully understand
                                   these mechanisms.[18]</p>
